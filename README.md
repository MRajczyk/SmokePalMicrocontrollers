# SmokePal Microcontrollers Source Code
Part of my Engineering thesis. Subfolder 10 save broker ip from form to eeprom" contains final source code used in my project.

## USAGE
To run code you will need Arduino IDE. <br>
Simply load the sketches and do whatever you wish with them!

## Hardware
There is a picture that presents schematic of my setup made in Fritzing. <br>
List of parts used: <br>
- Arduino Uno R3
- NodeMCUv2
- DS18B20 temperature sensors
- DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- SparkFun BOB-12009 3.3V -> 5.0V voltage converter
